### What is NewTab Pastels?
A fun minimalist & colorful customizable pastel themed new tab page with search bar.

### Features
- NewTab page slowly scrolls through the rainbow on each new tab.
- Customize your NewTab page with the sidebars.
- Add custom bookmarks directly to you new tab page.
- Random quotes to spark curiosity on each new tab.
- Dynamically adjust you browser theme to match you current color (optional).

### How To Use
- Move your mouse to either side of the screen and click the sidebar that appears to load the settings menu.
- The left settings allows you to pick color while the right lets you choose which elements are visible on the page.
- Click the plus button at the top bottom of the page (depending on settings) to add a bookmark.
- Right click on a bookmark to either delete bookmark or add a new one.
- Hover over both sidebars before they disappear to start a game of pong!

### Permissions
- Themes: Not used by default but if you select 'theme' in settings it will set you browser theme color to that of the new tab. This feature is experimental and may result in the loss of your previous theme if reversed. To get your old theme back you will need to access you themes settings with Add-ons and ``themes > Themes`` and re-enable the desired theme
